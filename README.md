Loan_Approval_Prediction_Model
This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant details such as income, credit history, education, and property area. The model is trained on a dataset containing demographic and financial information. We used preprocessing techniques including encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical ones. A Logistic Regression model  was implemented for classification. The solution can help financial institutions make data-driven approval decisions.
